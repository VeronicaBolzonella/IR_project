This assumption aligns with typical trends in the entertainment industry where actors who move from cameo appearances to leading roles often experience enhanced public and critical attention.\n\n[Supported]",

The most recent work mentioned, \"Phantom Detective,\" was released in 2016.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is: [Not Supported]",

The only direct mention of Oriflame relates to it being one of several brands she is associated with, but it doesn't specify her role.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the provided knowledge, while there is strong contextual relevance to suggest Koechlin might have served as an ambassador for Oriflame, the information is not explicitly definitive. Therefore, the supported statement needs more direct confirmation.\n\nFinal answer: Not Supported",

It focuses on early successional plants and organisms that can alter the environment.\n\n2. **VIA Music**: This knowledge discusses a Soviet-era musical group format characterized by a large number of musicians, professional background of members, specific performance restrictions, and links to subsequent successful careers.\n\n3. **Music Careers in Other Contexts**:\n   - Another piece mentions Nando Reis, a Brazilian musician who had successful careers in various bands and as a solo artist.\n   - Trevor Tanner is described as a British musician with a career involving multiple projects (post-punk/gothic, solo artist, band member).\n   - There's also information related to Pilar Bonet's journalism career but mentions her role covering Eastern Bloc news, primarily related to political and social changes in those regions.\n\nNow, let's examine how these pieces of knowledge relate to the statement \"Music Career\":\n\n- The VIA music description provides direct examples of musicians transitioning from collective groups to solo careers, which is a clear example of a music career.\n- The information about Nando Reis and Trevor Tanner similarly shows individual musicians having successful careers across different formations and projects.\n- The VIA example directly addresses the career aspect, providing a concrete model for how musicians evolve professionally.\n\nGiven these points, there is clear support for the idea that individuals in the music industry can have diverse and evolving careers. Both the VIA group and the individual artists provide evidence that supports the concept of a music career.\n\nRestating the statement: \"Music Career\" refers to the professional trajectory and evolution of a musician's career within the music industry.\n\n[Supported]",

In addition to Rundgren's solo recordings and those of his band Utopia, the label also recorded acts including Jesse Winchester, Foghat, Gil Evans, Paul Butterfield, Sparks, Felix Cavaliere, Randy Vanwarmer, Lazarus, Jesse Frederick, Roger Powell, NRBQ and The dB's.

Therefore, we infer that William Tell, being a fictional character or an artist in general, could fit this pattern based on the examples given.\n\n**Restated Statement**:  \nWilliam Tell exemplifies an artist who balances a career in music with furthering his education and personal life milestones.\n\n**Final Answer** [Supported]",
